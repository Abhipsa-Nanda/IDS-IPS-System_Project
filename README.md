<h3><u>Key Highlights</h3></U>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Intrusion Detection: Detects and alerts on potential threats.</li>
<li>Intrusion Prevention: Blocks attacks in real time based on detection rules.</li>
<li>Scalable: Can be deployed in small and large network environments.</li>
<li>Customizable: Supports custom rule sets for specific use cases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><h3><u>HOW CAN WE PREVENT THESE ATTACKS!</p></h3></u>
    <ul type="circle">
  <li>DDoS: While IDS/IPS can detect certain DDoS attacks, it's often more effective as a secondary defense. Dedicated DDoS mitigation solutions are typically required for comprehensive protection. However, IDS/IPS can help identify the initial attack vectors.</li>

<li>Ping of Death: Most modern systems are resilient to ping of death attacks. IDS/IPS can detect and block malformed packets. </li>

<li>SQL Injection: IDS/IPS can detect and prevent SQL injection attacks by inspecting incoming traffic for suspicious patterns.</li>

<li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: IDS/IPS can detect some MitM attacks by verifying digital certificates and inspecting encrypted traffic (if configured to do so). However, it's often challenging to prevent these attacks solely with IDS/IPS</li>

<li>Brute Force Attacks: IDS/IPS can detect and block brute force attacks by monitoring failed login attempts.</li>
